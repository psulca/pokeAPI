# Overview

This document describes my solution to the technical test to fetch data from the PokéAPI and display a list of Pokémon and two views for the list and details for each Pokémon.

## Solution

My solution is a web application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to fetch data from the PokeAPI and display it in two views: a list view and a details view.

### List View

The list view displays a list of all Pokémon, with each Pokémon represented by a card. The card includes the Pokémon's name, image, and type.

### Details View

The details view displays all of the information about a single Pokémon, including its name, image, type, stats, and moves.

## Implementation

I used the following technologies to implement my solution:

HTML: To create the structure of my web pages.
CSS: To style my web pages.
JavaScript: To fetch data from the PokéAPI and display it in my web pages.
TypeScript: To recognize datatypes.
React: A JavaScript library that I used to create my web application.
React-Router: To manage views.
TailwindCSS.
